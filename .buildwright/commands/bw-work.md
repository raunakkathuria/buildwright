# /bw-work

Use this for implementation work: bug fixes, refactors, small changes, and new
features. The command chooses the lightest workflow that still protects quality.

## Core Loop

```
Understand -> Research -> Plan if needed -> Red -> Green -> Refactor -> Docs -> Verify -> Security -> Review -> Commit/Ship
```

Always recursively discover and read all `.md` files under
`.buildwright/steering/`. Read `philosophy.md` first when present because it is
the default baseline. Also recursively read `.buildwright/codebase/*.md` if
that directory exists.

Follow `.buildwright/framework/autonomy.md` for the single autonomy behaviour and
auto-continue (work through ready, question-free items without per-item
re-invocation; pause only on a genuine decision). Prefer the host's native
capabilities per `.buildwright/framework/capability.md` — use native
task/todo tracking for the loop and native file writes rather than reimplementing
them in prose.

When you defer a decision (acceptable for staging, must fix before production) or
spot an issue better fixed upstream, record it per
`.buildwright/framework/findings.md` as it arises — don't leave it scattered.

## Phase 1: Understand

Parse `$ARGUMENTS.task` and identify:
- Work type: bug fix, feature, refactor, config/docs change
- Project state: greenfield or brownfield
- Scope: small/bounded or larger/unclear
- User-facing impact and documentation likely affected

If no project files exist, ask for product vision and constraints. Create
`.buildwright/steering/product.md` from the answer and create `tech.md` after
the stack and commands are chosen.

## Phase 2: Command Discovery

If `.buildwright/steering/tech.md` exists and has real commands, use them.
Otherwise auto-detect from project files:

- `package.json` -> npm/pnpm/yarn/bun scripts
- `Cargo.toml` -> cargo
- `go.mod` -> go
- `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` -> Python tooling
- `Makefile` -> make targets

Derive typecheck, lint, test, build, and dev commands. Mark unavailable gates as
`SKIP`. Write a real `.buildwright/steering/tech.md` so future runs reuse the
discovery result. If detection is ambiguous, ask for the missing commands.

## Phase 3: Research

For small, clear tasks, do lightweight research in context:
- Read only directly relevant source files and tests
- Reuse existing functions, types, and patterns
- Check `.buildwright/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md` if present

For larger or unclear work, write:
- `docs/specs/[feature]/research.md`
- `docs/specs/[feature]/spec.md`

The spec must include scope, approach, risks, test strategy, documentation
impact, and implementation milestones. Follow the single autonomy behaviour
(`.buildwright/framework/autonomy.md`): proceed autonomously, pausing for approval
before implementation only when the approach involves a decision that is
genuinely the human's to make.

Cross-domain work still uses a normal spec and implementation plan. Do not use
legacy multi-agent terminology or domain-specialist personas.

## Phase 4: Implement with TDD

For every bug fix, behavior change, or feature milestone:

### Red

Write or update a failing test that describes the bug or expected behavior. Run
the focused test and confirm it fails for the right reason.

### Green

Make the smallest implementation that passes the test. Follow existing
patterns, reuse existing utilities, and avoid speculative abstractions.

### Refactor

Improve names, structure, duplication, and design while tests stay green. Keep
the scope tied to the current requirement.

## Phase 5: Documentation Check

Documentation is part of done. Before verification, update every affected
user-facing artifact:
- README or setup docs
- docs/ guides or API reference
- command/help text
- examples
- CHANGELOG, if the project uses one

If no documentation update is needed, record the reason in the final report.

## Phase 6: Verify

Run the discovered gates:
1. Typecheck
2. Lint
3. Test
4. Build

Skip only gates that are genuinely unavailable for the stack. If a required
gate fails, fix and re-run it. Keep going until the gate passes or you are no
longer making progress — the same failure recurs, or there is no diagnosable
fix. Do not loop indefinitely; on a stalled gate, hand off per the failure
behaviour.

## Phase 7: Security Review

Adopt the Security Engineer persona from `.buildwright/agents/security-engineer.md`
(or `~/.claude/agents/security-engineer.md` for a global install without a project
`.buildwright/`). Review the changed diff for:
- Secrets
- Dependency vulnerabilities, if tooling exists
- Input validation and authorization
- OWASP Top 10 risks
- Financial-code risks, especially floating point for currency

Stop on critical vulnerabilities.

## Phase 8: Code Review

Adopt the Staff Engineer persona from `.buildwright/agents/staff-engineer.md`
(or `~/.claude/agents/staff-engineer.md` for a global install without a project
`.buildwright/`). Review the changed diff for:
- Logic errors and missed edge cases
- Error handling
- Pattern fit and unnecessary complexity
- Missing tests
- Missing documentation updates

Fix blocking issues before committing.

## Phase 9: Commit or Ship

Use atomic conventional commits and stage only files changed for this work.

For small local work, commit and report the result. For PR-ready work, run
`/bw-ship` after verification, security, and review have passed. Verify,
security, and review just passed here — when `/bw-ship` runs next in the same run
and the working tree is unchanged, it reuses these results (its "Gate reuse"
rule) rather than re-running them. Report which gates passed and at what commit
so the reuse is unambiguous.

## Final Report

Report:
- Task and work type
- Files changed
- Tests and gates run
- Documentation updated, or why not applicable
- Commit hash or PR URL if created
